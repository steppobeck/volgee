// A simple OpenGL error checking routine. This compiles away
// to a no-op inline method if the NDEBUG preprocessor symbol
// is defined during compilation.
//
// - The first parameter (optional) is a string that can be
//   used to indicate the location where the error check occurs.
//
// - The second parameter determines the destination of the error
//   message. It defaults to cerr, but could also be a file.
